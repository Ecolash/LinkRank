\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Testing the model on cross-domain datasets is a critical part of our future research. This will provide valuable insights into the model's efficacy, robustness, and adaptability in a wider context.
    \item Given the rapid advancements in the field, newer Large Language Model (LLM) variants are expected. Our future work will explore and optimize these emerging models for specific tasks through continuous comparative analysis.
    \item An important focus of our future work will be to identify and extract significant features from textual data. This will not only enhance our model's understanding of data but also improve its predictive capabilities.
    \item Summaries Tracing: Incorporate a strategy to trace abstractive summaries back to the original text for increased transparency.
    \item Knowledge Graph Implementation: Plan to develop a knowledge graph for a comprehensive, visual representation of the repository, which will simultaneously serve as a dynamic, real-time documentation tool for new team members to understand the codebase efficiently.
